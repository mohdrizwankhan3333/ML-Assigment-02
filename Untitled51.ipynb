    " Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of related events' probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    " Q2. What is the formula for Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "Bayes' theorem formula is \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    " Q3. How is Bayes' theorem used in practice?\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is used in medical diagnosis, spam filtering, and machine learning to update probabilities based on new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    " Q4. What is the relationship between Bayes' theorem and conditional probability?\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that calculates conditional probability, the likelihood of an event given the occurrence of another event.\n",
    "\n",
    " Q5. How do you choose which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for any given problem?\n",
    "Choose based on data type: Gaussian for continuous, Multinomial for discrete counts, and Bernoulli for binary/Boolean features.\n",
